Imagine you are building a toy robot 🚗.
To make it move:

    server.js is like the power button – it starts your robot (your backend).

    app.js is like the brain – it tells your robot what to do when someone presses a button (like register or login).

So when someone visits your website, the server says:

    “Okay! What do you want? I’ll ask app.js what to do.”
